# Customer Personality Analysis - Data Analysis & Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior and spending habits using a dataset from Kaggle.  
The analysis was performed in **Python** (Jupyter Notebook) for data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization, and a **Power BI Dashboard** was created to visualize the results.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-personality-analysis.git
```
2. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:
```bash
jupyter notebook customer_personality_analysis.ipynb
```
3. **Open Power BI Dashboard**:
   - Download `dashboard.pbix`
   - Open it using **Power BI Desktop**

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
- The dashboard contains **visualizations** for customer spending habits, demographics, and purchasing patterns.
- Due to the dataset not containing enough customer details, **no dedicated "Details" page** was created in the report.
- No Power BI Online account was used — dashboard is provided as a `.pbix` file and screenshots instead of a live link.
